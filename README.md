# Offline FortiClientVPN installers

## Copyright notice
This repository exists for the purpose of preservation of FortiClient VPN offline installers. I do not in any way hold the copyright for any Fortinet products and their subsidiaries. The publication of their offline installers do not allow free access to their services. You still require a Fortigate router and a valid license. Additionally, this repository is not to be used as an alternative for Fortinet Support. This is a binary repository, not a support service. Go to https://support.fortinet.com for support relating to their products.
